    <h1>Learning Journal: Cognition & Computers</h1>

      <h3>Beginning Reflections</h3>
      <p>Before jumping in to this journal, I thought it best to get oriented with some initial observations about my learning. I realize that I am a product of old school schooling in the 'transmissionist' ways (even calling myself a product here is apt), so being in control of it makes me feel a little uncertain. I am comfortable with the 'teacher' providing clear lesson plans for me to follow, letting me tick off the to-dos that inevitably lead to greater understanding. And self reflection is not one of my strengths, nor have I ever kept a journal for any extended period of time. So really, this exercise will be a good push into new, unfamiliar territory.</p>
      <h3>Current Tech Learning Tendencies</h3>
      <p>Now in my second semester, I find the ITM program extremely rewarding, and the multiple resources made available (through Lynda, online in general, books, blogs, you tube) can almost become a distraction when I need to just focus on the task at hand in front of me (maybe this is why I like that teacher task list, without it, I wander). Additionally, there are a LOT of tech programs ut there that I feel I should know, but don't so I have this sense of needing to catch up. This is not a terrible thing in itself, but it also can be distracting when I just need to focus on that one thing. For example, right now I have over 125 Lynda courses saved to eventually work through.</p>
      <p>In any case, the technologies that I have chosen are to build on my skills in front-end web development and interactive media. This is a journey that started last semester in Interactive Media I but I feel like I lagged behind the class, and though I did well enough, grade-wise, I spent a lot of time catching up with JavaScript over winter break. I am aware that coding takes a long time, but I sometimes lack patience and want to become an instant expert... right away! I have learned many foreign languages -- even ancent Greek-- but programming wins the prize in difficulty: it's so ... alien. This semester in Interactive Media II, we are learning a variation of JavaScript: Vue.js so that is my technology #1. The second tech program is Adobe Captivate, a major platform for creating interactive learning modules. And the third (but perhaps not final) is Adobe Animate. I am a visual/design person and frankly, I think this will be a fun way to apply my artistic sensibilities.</p>

    <h3 id="vue">Vue.js</h3>
    <p>Vue.js is a Javascript framework that I am learning through MSTU course 5013 with Dr. Jin Kuwata. This is a required course for the Instructional Technology and Media program, so I suppose that is my main motivation. But I do have an interest in learning it, I would like to become competent in front end web development, but that seems so far away right now! Programming is a challenge as its just required an absolutely different mindset, so this is will be the biggest challenge of the chosen technologies. My comfort level with JavaScript is low, so I will be building my skills of Vue.js on a foundation with very shaky legs. Fortunately, there will be numerous resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dr. Kuwata and TA</li>
      <li>Structured class projects and challenges</li>
      <li>Lynda.com courses (Ray Villalobos) and Udemy courses (Stephen Grider)</li>
      <li>Online resources and books</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So far, I have worked through a bit of Stephen Glider's Udemy course, which I liked initially very very much. He started slowly and clearly with the lessons and outlined the distinct mindset that one has to adopt for programming: declarative (vs more everyday imperative).If you imagine a recipe, for example, imperative instructions would outline step by step instructions such as 1) mix flour and sugar, 2) beat eggs and chocolate and vanilla, 3) add wet to dry ingredients, mix, and 4) bake. In contrast, declarative ingredients are more conditional: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>assemble ingredients (beginning state) </li>
      <li>if flour and sugar mixed, add egg mixture</li>
      <li>if eggs mixed, add to flour</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each step is conditional upon the other. It's a subtle but useful way to get in the 'Vue.js' mood. In this initial module, I also liked that he diagrammed out in plain English what steps were needed for the app-to-be-developed, before the coding even began. This is good protocol. Unfortunately he lost me in module 3, after the installation of some other add-ons (Node, webpack, vuex, Vue/cli, etc). I followed his outline step by step, but did not get a page to display as it should have. I find that this is the difficulty (for me) in the online videos: no scaffolding or way to get assistance on such troubleshooting issues. Other instructors just jump right in to the topic and seemed to have forgotten what it's like to not know about the topic. They are SMEs but not effective teachers. One needs a personal, responsive guru. And lots of practice.</p>

    <h3 id="captivate">Captivate</h3>
    <p>Captivate is the Mac/Adobe version of Articulate 360 and can be a powerful too in creating interactive modules for online or distance learning. My primary motivation in pursuing this is 1) I really, really enjoy design and have a knack for creating presentations, and 2) to become more employable, as Articulate and Captivate are core skills required for most Instructional Design postings. To learn this program, I signed up for an Adobe certification course which entails 8 hours of video, 40 hours of homework and an assessment on April 14th in Washington DC.</p>

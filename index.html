      <h3>Beginning Reflections</h3>
      <p>Before jumping in to this journal, I thought it best to get oriented with some initial observations about my learning. I realize that I am a product of old school schooling in the 'transmissionist' ways (even calling myself a product here is apt), so being in control of it makes me feel a little uncertain. I am comfortable with the 'teacher' providing clear lesson plans for me to follow, letting me tick off the to-dos that inevitably lead to greater understanding. And self reflection is not one of my strengths, nor have I ever kept a journal for any extended period of time. So really, this exercise will be a good push into new, unfamiliar territory.</p>
      <h3>Current Tech Learning Tendencies</h3>
      <p>Now in my second semester, I find the ITM program extremely rewarding, and the multiple resources made available (through Lynda, online in general, books, blogs, you tube) can almost become a distraction when I need to just focus on the task at hand in front of me (maybe this is why I like that teacher task list, without it, I wander). Additionally, there are a LOT of tech programs ut there that I feel I should know, but don't so I have this sense of needing to catch up. This is not a terrible thing in itself, but it also can be distracting when I just need to focus on that one thing. For example, right now I have over 125 Lynda courses saved to eventually work through.</p>
      <p>In any case, the technologies that I have chosen are to build on my budding skills in front-end web development and interactive media. This is a journey that started last semester in Interactive Media I but I feel like I lagged behind the class, and though I did well enough, grade-wise, I spent a lot of time catching up with JavaScript over winter break. I am aware that coding takes a long time, but I sometimes lack patience and want to become an instant expert... right away! I have learned many foreign languages -- even ancent Greek-- but programming wins the prize. This semester in Interactive Media II, we are learning a variation of JavaScript: Vue.js so that is my technology #1. The second tech program is Adobe Captivate, a major platform for interactive learning modules. And the third (but perhaps not final) is Adobe Animate. I am a visual/design person and frankly, I think this will be a fun way to apply my artistic sensibilities.</p>

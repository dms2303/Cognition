      <h3>Beginning Reflections</h3>
      <p>Before jumping in to this journal, I thought it best to get oriented with some initial observations about my learning. I realize that I am a product of old school schooling in the 'transmissionist' ways (even calling myself a product here is apt), so being in control of it makes me feel a little uncertain. I am comfortable with the 'teacher' providing clear lesson plans for me to follow, letting me tick off the to-dos that inevitably lead to greater understanding. And self reflection is not one of my strengths, nor have I ever kept a journal for any extended period of time. So really, this exercise will be a good push into new, unfamiliar territory.</p>
      <h3>Current Tech Learning Tendencies</h3>
      <p>Now in my second semester, I find the ITM program extremely rewarding, and the multiple resources made available (through Lynda, online in general, books, blogs, you tube) can almost become a distraction when I need to just focus on the task at hand in front of me (maybe this is why I like that teacher task list, without it, I wander). Additionally, there are a LOT of tech programs ut there that I feel I should know, but don't so I have this sense of needing to catch up. This is not a terrible thing in itself, but it also can be distracting when I just need to focus on that one thing. For example, right now I have over 125 Lynda courses saved to eventually work through.</p>
      <p>In any case, the technologies that I have chosen are to build on my skills in front-end web development and interactive media. This is a journey that started last semester in Interactive Media I but I feel like I lagged behind the class, and though I did well enough, grade-wise, I spent a lot of time catching up with JavaScript over winter break. I am aware that coding takes a long time, but I sometimes lack patience and want to become an instant expert... right away! I have learned many foreign languages -- even ancent Greek-- but programming wins the prize in difficulty: it's so ... alien. This semester in Interactive Media II, we are learning a variation of JavaScript: Vue.js so that is my technology #1. The second tech program is Adobe Captivate, a major platform for creating interactive learning modules. And the third (but perhaps not final) is Adobe Animate. I am a visual/design person and frankly, I think this will be a fun way to apply my artistic sensibilities.</p>

    <h3 id="vue">Vue.js</h3>
    <p>Vue.js is a Javascript framework that I am learning through MSTU course 5013 with Dr. Jin Kuwata. This is a required course for the Instructional Technology and Media program, so I suppose that is my main motivation. But I do have an interest in learning it, I would like to become competent in front end web development, but that seems so far away right now! Programming is a challenge as its just required an absolutely different mindset, so this is will be the biggest challenge of the chosen technologies. My comfort level with JavaScript is low, so I will be building my skills of Vue.js on a foundation with very shaky legs. Fortunately, there will be numerous resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dr. Kuwata and TA</li>
      <li>Structured class projects and challenges</li>
      <li>Lynda.com courses (Ray Villalobos) and Udemy courses (Stephen Grider)</li>
      <li>Online resources and books</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So far, I have worked through a bit of Stephen Glider's Udemy course, which I liked initially very very much. He started slowly and clearly with the lessons and outlined the distinct mindset that one has to adopt for programming: declarative (vs more everyday imperative).If you imagine a recipe, for example, imperative instructions would outline step by step instructions such as 1) mix flour and sugar, 2) beat eggs and chocolate and vanilla, 3) add wet to dry ingredients, mix, and 4) bake. In contrast, declarative ingredients are more conditional: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>assemble ingredients (beginning state) </li>
      <li>if flour and sugar mixed, add egg mixture</li>
      <li>if eggs mixed, add to flour</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each step is conditional upon the other. It's a subtle but useful way to get in the 'Vue.js' mood. In this initial module, I also liked that he diagrammed out in plain English what steps were needed for the app-to-be-developed, before the coding even began. This is good protocol. Unfortunately he lost me in module 3, after the installation of some other add-ons (Node, webpack, vuex, Vue/cli, etc). I followed his outline step by step, but did not get a page to display as it should have. I find that this is the difficulty (for me) in the online videos: no scaffolding or way to get assistance on such troubleshooting issues. Other instructors just jump right in to the topic and seemed to have forgotten what it's like to not know about the topic. They are SMEs but not effective teachers. One needs a personal, responsive guru. And lots of practice.</p>
    <h5>Update, 2/21/20</h5>
    <p>Vue/Javascript continues to be a challenge. I've attempted to seek out side resources (through Lynda and Udemy, as mentioned above). Unfortunately, these tutorials tend to advance quite quickly, with the introduction of add-on webpacks etc. I try to follow, but then run into difficulty with the download, or my screen doesn't result in same web format, or some such. And because this is instruction delivered one way, there is really no one to contact if I need individual help. There is no scaffolding or support.</p>
    <p>So my strategy has shifted to staying strictly to the course with MSTU 5013, I am going to limit my educational sources (which were beginning to overwhelm me). I think of JS often through the course readings for this class. Questions such as how do you introduce abstract information? or do you present a bigger picture view and work back from that? In my case, I am appreciating just seeing the instances worked through, I suppose because of my lack of prior knowledge. I keep waiting for that 'aha' when it all clicks.</p>
    <p>One thing that has been really helpful is keeping a code journal on codepen. Per Jin Kuwata, these 'pens' need not be fancy, just a measure that we are putting some of the theory to practice. It's useful for me to do this right away while the content is fresh, and I keep several examples on my dashboard for later reference and guidance. As well, Jin Kuwata posts videos of the classes to Slack, along with other resources, cheat sheets, slides to assist in the learning.</p>

    <h3 id="captivate">Captivate</h3>
    <p>Captivate is the Mac/Adobe version of Articulate 360 and can be a powerful too in creating interactive modules for online or distance learning. My primary motivation in pursuing this is 1) I really, really enjoy design and have a knack for creating presentations, and 2) to become more employable, as Articulate and Captivate are core skills required for most Instructional Design postings. To learn this program, I signed up for an Adobe certification course which entails 8 hours of video, 40 hours of homework and an assessment on April 14th in Washington DC.</p>
    <h5>Update, 2/21/20</h5>
    <p>As part of the certification preparation, I have received 20 modules of about 120 different videos that run from anywhere from 2-8 minutes each. Eager to work through them, I watched through the first ten modules straight, and was thinking that I was absorbing it well enough. Shortly thereafter, I was asked to provide a sample of my Captivate possibilities and found that it hadn't really stuck after all. As with Vue/JS. There really is no substitute for hands-on practice and application. Unlike Vue, Adobe Captivate is complex, but the steps are much more concrete than abstract, so find the learning much more enjoyable. In any case, I decided to slow the learning down and take advantage of the segmented quality of the instruction. On this second round (and I have not yet cycled through all the videos completely), I am taking pretty thorough notes and striving to be less passive in the learning.</p>
    <p>I continue to be motivated by the possibilities with this program, especially in terms of building in video, 360 hotspot activities and animation. </p>

    <h3 id="animate">Adobe Animate</h3>
    <p>As my third technology of choice, Animate offers yet another creative addition to utilize in both Captivate and HTML5 (and I do recognize that ultimately, Captivate and Animate are JS too.) I am a little less certain exactly how I will put this potentially new skill to work. At the outset, and now being more familiar with Cognitive Load Theory, I would not want any such instructional media to interfere with the essential processing in learning. I think I have yet to understand exactly how to incorporate it into effective instructional design without it becoming a distraction. One idea is to use it to create more visual JavaScript lessons ... but still working that one out.</p>
    <h5>Update 2/20/20</h5>
    <p>I have not yet made too much progress with Animate. I have watched a few tutorials but I am having difficulty in finding good, clear instruction. The program itself (formerly known as Flash) has undergone changes, so it is at the moment a little unclear whether instructions on past versions are relevent. As well, there are far more specializations within this program, such as HTML banners, character animation, storyboarding, animating scenes and so forth. Tonight I did find a good video on youtube, but the program is farm more complex than I expected.</p>
